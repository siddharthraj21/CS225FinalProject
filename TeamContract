# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    We will be meeting three times a week for one hour. These meetings will be held usually in person, with some maybe occurring over Zoom. We will alternate who will be taking notes for the meeting.
2. **Assistance** 
    We all live relatively close, so we will be contacting each other in person or over the phone. We should be expected to respond within the same day.
3. **Respect** 
    At the end of each meeting, we will go around and make sure that every team member has had a chance to give their input. Each team member will have 2-3 minutes to speak on what progress they have made prior to the meeting and also ask any pending questions. To ensure that everyone is listening to the other team members, we will all take notes on the highlights of the meeting.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    We will assign work to team members equally, so that nobody is doing the heavylifting and nobody is being lazy. If we notice team members who are not holding up their end of the work, we will bring it up at the team meeting and make sure they get back on track, helping them if needed. We will also identify which team members are more strong in backend coding, who is strong in graphing structures, and who are more strong in working with databases. Depending on this, we will divide up the work amongst the preferences and strengths.
5. **Time Commitment** 
    Each team member is expected to work for 3-4 hours a week outside of the weekly meeting times. This independent work is essential to make progress on our project. As of right now, there are no significant time commitments that could hinder our progress on this project. If some potential time commitments or conflicts occur, we will make a schedule so that work can still get done on time, and people will not have to sacrifice their other commitments.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    If there is a disagreement between team members, we will resolve it by having them display their arguments and having team members vote on which method to approach. If team members have not completed their weekly tasks, we will set a rule that they must complete the prior weeks tasks within 24 hours of the meetings end. This will ensure late work will still be done on time. If someone is consistently late, we will have a strict talk and we may also have to contact our mentor, although we do not anticipate this happening. Another situation we want to address is if someone is consistently not attending team meetings. If this were to occur, we would speak with them respectfully and ask them to still display the work they have completed.
